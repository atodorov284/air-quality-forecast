  "‚ö†Ô∏è Why O\u2083 and NO\u2082 Matter": [
    "**Ozone (O\u2083)**: Formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, particularly on sunny days. High levels can cause chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and airway inflammation. \n\n **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO\u2082)**: Mostly emitted from vehicles and industrial activities, this can cause irritation of the respiratory system and decrease lung function, especially during long-term exposure."
